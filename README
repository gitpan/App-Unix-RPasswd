App-Unix-RPasswd

App::Unix::RPasswd is an application to change passwords on UNIX and 
UNIX-like servers on a simple, fast (parallellized) and secure (SSH) way.
Retrievable 'random' passwords unique for each server can be generated and
automatically applied. Because the salt is secret, the passwords can only be 
regenerated by authorized personnel.
